## Titanic - Binary classification ML
This project is focused on applying supervised machine learning algorithms for binary classification using the Titanic dataset. The objective is to find a classification model that accurately predicts if passengers survived.

Check out my binary classification project in this [python jupiter notebook](https://github.com/noursan/titanic/blob/main/titanic.ipynb)
